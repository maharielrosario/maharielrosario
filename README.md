Hi, I'm Mahariel Rosario and I am a front end software engineer that utilizes technology to compose apps that look and perform great!

## About Me

Since I was a kid, I was deeply fascinated with computers and I've let that curiousity drive me to leveraging technology to make positive impacts for companies in multiple industries. I've studied IT and front end web development but my interest in education is a recursive loop; the more I learn, the more I want to learn.

Frameworks and Libraries: Angular, React

Tests: Cypress, Jest, Jasmine

CI/ CD: Jenkins, Bitbucket, GitHub


## Professional Goals
